title: Understanding Double Robustness via Logical Operators  
---
This post mainly focused on how to decipher the underlying mechanism of doubly robust estimators via logical operators, which was introduced in causal inference II course.

## General Framework
### Setup
Consider $n$ i.i.d. observations: $ \\{ (X_i, Z_i, Y_i) \\}_{i=1}^n$, where $X_i$ is the baseline covariates, $Z_i \in \\{ 0,1 \\}$ indicates the assignment of control or treatment group. $Y_i$ is the observed outcome for observation $i$.

### Potential Outcome Model
Let $Y_i = Z_i Y_i(1) + (1-Z_i) Y_i(0)$, where $Y_i(z)$ is the *potential outcome* under treatment $z$. Therefore $Y_i(z)$ could be observed if sample $i$ is assigned to treatment $z$.

### Estimand and Notations
Our goal is to estimate the average outcome if all the observations are assigned to treatment group $Z = 1$, and the subscript 0 indicates *true unknown value* throughout this post.

$$
\tau_0 = E_0 (Y(1))
$$

The notations for potential outcome under treatment conditioning on covariates and  propensity score are as follows :

$$
\begin{align*}
& y_0(x_i) = E_0 (Y_i | Z_i = 1, X_i = x_i) \\
& e_0(x_i) = Pr_0 (Z_i = 1 | X_i = x_i )
\end{align*}
$$


### Assumptions
> Assumption 1 (Strong Ignorability)
$$
Y_i(0), Y_i(1) \bot Z_i \ | \ X_i
$$

> Assumption 2 (Overlap)
$$
0< Pr(Z_i =1 | x_i) < 1
$$

> Assumption 3 (SUVTA)
Stable unit treatment value assumption



## Double Robustness
The following estimator is a *doubly robust estimator*, since it produces the correct estimation if the estimation of response surface $\hat{y}$ **OR** the propensity score $\hat{e}$ is correct.

$$
\hat{\tau}_{DR} = \frac{1}{n} \sum \hat{y}(x_i) + \frac{y_i z_i}{\hat{e}(x_i)}  - \frac{\hat{y}(x_i) z_i}{\hat{e}(x_i)}
$$

## Logical Operators Characterization
We define the **AND** operator as

$$
\tau^{AND}(y,e) = \tau_0 \ \text{if} \ y=y_0 \ \text{AND} \ e = e_0
$$

we then introduce **OR** operator as

$$
\tau^{OR}(y,e) = \tau^{AND}(y,e_0) + \tau^{AND}(y_0,e) - \tau^{AND}(y,e)  
$$

We could observe that **AND** operator gives correct estimation if both $y$ and $e$ are correct, while **OR** operator gives correct estimation if at least one of $y$ and $e$ is correct.

Next, we intuitively demonstrate that the above doubly robust estimator belongs to **OR** operator class.

From the above figure, we could reformulate the doubly robust estimator as

$$
\hat{\tau}_{DR} = \frac{1}{n} \sum \underbrace{\hat{y}(x_i)}_{\tau^{AND}(y,e_0)} + \underbrace{\frac{y_i z_i}{\hat{e}(x_i)}}_{\tau^{AND}(y_0,e)}  - \underbrace{ \frac{\hat{y}(x_i) z_i}{\hat{e}(x_i)}}_{\tau^{AND}(y,e)}
$$

The double robustness property of **OR** operators could be illustrated in the following scenarios:

1. $ \hat{e} = e_0$ and $\hat{y} = y_0$ (both the propensity score model and response surface model are correct) <br>
All the three **AND** estimators $\to$ true value $\tau_0$.

2.  $ \hat{e} = e_0$ but $\hat{y} \neq y_0$ (the propensity score model is correct while the response surface model is incorrect) <br>
$$ \tau^{AND}(y_0,e) \to \tau_0$$; $$ \tau^{AND}(y,e) \ \text{and} \ \tau^{AND}(y,e_0) \to $$ *same incorrect value*. Therefore, the **OR** operator could offset the incorrect value.

3.  $ \hat{y} = y_0$ but $\hat{e} \neq e_0$ (the response surface model is correct while the propensity score model is incorrect) <br>
$$ \tau^{AND}(y,e_0) \to \tau_0$$; $$ \tau^{AND}(y,e) \ \text{and} \ \tau^{AND}(y_0,e) \to $$ *same incorrect value*. Therefore, the **OR** operator could offset the incorrect value.
