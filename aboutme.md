My name is Runzhe Li. I am a 4th year undergrad student at [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. I conducted summer internship at [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/), Johns Hopkins University in 2017.

My research interests are machine learning, variable selection in high dimensions, and their application in genomics.(especially high-throughput genomic data).
