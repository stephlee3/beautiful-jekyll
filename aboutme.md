My name is Runzhe Li. I am a second-year PhD student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), Johns Hopkins University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/) and Prof. [Ni Zhao](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~nzhao/). I also worked closely with some collaborators on single-cell immunotherapy projects.

I received my Bachelor degree from [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2018, specialized in Probabilty and Statistics. I worked with Prof. [Xuegong Zhang](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/CSSB/web/english/people/zhangxuegong.html) at Tsinghua, and completed my undergrad thesis with Prof. [Sheng Yu](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/yu-sheng/).

I have broad interests in biostatistics and bioinformatics. My current research interests are developing
- computational efficient and scalable statistical methods to analyze single cell genomic data.
- kernel regression models and association testing framework for microbiome study.


I am also interested in treatment effect estimation in clinical trials, Bayesian hierarchical models, optimization etc.
