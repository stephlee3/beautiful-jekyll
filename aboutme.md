My name is Runzhe Li. I am a first-year PhD student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), Johns Hopkins University. My academic advisor is Prof. [Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/). 

I received my Bachelor degree from [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2018, specialized in Probabilty and Statistics. I worked with Prof. [Xuegong Zhang](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/CSSB/web/english/people/zhangxuegong.html) at Tsinghua, and completed my undergrad thesis with Prof. [Sheng Yu](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/yu-sheng/).

I have broad interests in statistics and data science. My current research interests are developing statistical methodologies and machine learning (deep learning) approaches to address scientific problems in genomics, electronic medical records etc. I am now interested in statistical data integration.
