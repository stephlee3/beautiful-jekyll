subtitle: 4th year undergrad student at Tsinghua University
---


My name is Runzhe Li. I am a 4th year undergrad student at [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University. I conducted summer internship at [Department of Biostatistics](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/), Johns Hopkins University in 2017.

My research interests are machine learning theory, variable selection in high dimensions, and their application in genomics and genetics.

- **machine learning**: I am particularly interested in unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering and graphical models. I want to explore some novel machine learning methods with good statistical properties. 

- **variable selection in high dimensions**: Many variable selection methods are designed for "large _p_, small _n_" problems. Regularization and stepwise methods are most commonly used. 

- **application of statistics**: I am interested in application in genomics and genetics, especially high throughput genomic data. In general, I want to develop statistical and computational tools to solve real-world problems.
