My name is Runzhe Li. I am a third-year PhD student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/) and Prof. [Ni Zhao](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~nzhao/). I also worked closely with several collaborators from [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg~Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/kimmel_cancer_center/cancers_we_treat/bloomberg_kimmel_institute_for_cancer_immunotherapy/).

I received my Bachelor degree from [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2018, specialized in Probabilty and Statistics. I worked with Prof. [Xuegong Zhang](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/CSSB/web/english/people/zhangxuegong.html) at Tsinghua, and completed my undergrad thesis with Prof. [Sheng Yu](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/yu-sheng/).

My primary research interests are developing
- computational and statistical methods to integrate and analyze single-cell genomic data.
- kernel regression models and association tests for microbiome studies.

I am also interested in causal inference and machine learning in general.
