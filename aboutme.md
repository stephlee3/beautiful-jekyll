My name is Runzhe Li. I am a second-year PhD student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), Johns Hopkins University. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Hongkai Ji](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hji/).

I received my Bachelor degree from [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2018, specialized in Probabilty and Statistics. I worked with Prof. [Xuegong Zhang](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/CSSB/web/english/people/zhangxuegong.html) at Tsinghua, and completed my undergrad thesis with Prof. [Sheng Yu](http://www.stat.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/teambuilder/faculty/yu-sheng/).

I have broad interests in statistics and data science. My current research interests are developing statistical methodologies and machine learning (deep learning) approaches to address scientific problems in single-cell genomics,  electronic medical records etc.
