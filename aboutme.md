My name is Runzhe Li. I am a first-year PhD student at [Department of Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), Johns Hopkins University. I received my Bachelor degree from [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://math.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University in July 2018.

I have broad interests in statistics and data science. My current research interests are developing statistical methodologies and machine learning (deep learning) approaches to address scientific problems in genomics, brain imaging, electronic medical records etc.
