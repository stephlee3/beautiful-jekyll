<img src="/img/research_img/bird_model.PNG">

- Leverage gene expression measurements to predict DNase-seq level via [BIRD](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01188-x), a cluster-based method to solve high-dimensional regression problems.
- Propose normalization methods and incorporate a weighted ridge regression approach to handle "platform effect".


#### The Analysis of Electronic Medical Records | Tsinghua University

- Generate synthetic electronic health records in Chinese free texts via mtGAN, a conditional model to produce designated diseases.
- Work on statistical and machine learning methods to address sequence labeling problems, with application to recognizing key terms in clinical texts.
