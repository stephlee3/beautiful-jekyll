### Research Projects
  
#### [Cross-Platform Prediction of Regulome Activities | Johns Hopkins Univ.](/research/cross_platform)
- Utilize gene expression data to predict DNase-level by [BIRD](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01188-x), a cluster-based method to solve high-dimensional regression problems.
- Propose novel normalization methods and theoretical framework to handle "platform effect". 
- Work on the paper(In progress).

  
#### Chinese Medical Text Analysis | Tsinghua Univ.
- Design the work flow for electronic health records analysis:  Word segmentation, key word extraction, dictionary building, vector representation, metric learning.
- Generate medical records datasets via deep generative models. Work on the paper(In progress).
- Undergraduate thesis working on the _"Statistical and machine learning methods to recognize terms in clinical texts"_, propose a semi-supervised learning approach to address sequence labeling problems in Chinese texts. 
  
#### Variable Selection in High-dimensional Classification Problems | Tsinghua Univ.
- Propose clustering-SODA to solve regression problems with multivariate response. (SODA is a stepwise variable and interaction selection procedure)
- Implement the method on eQTL data.


#### The University Recommendation System | Tsinghua Univ.
- Design a recommendation list for high school students based on their ranks and scores.
- Collaborate with APP: [Perfect Application](https://www.wmzy.com/)
- keywords: Probability estimation, Mathematical programming, Dynamic programming.
