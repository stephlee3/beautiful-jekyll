### Research Projects
  
#### Cross-Platform Prediction of Regulome Activities | Johns Hopkins Univ.
- Use gene expression to predict DNase-level based on [BIRD](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01188-x) 
- Propose normalization methods to deal with the platform effect.
- Work on the paper.
- [See the code here!(In progress)](https://github.com/stephlee3/Cross-Platform-Prediction-of-Regulome-Activities)
  
#### Chinese Medical Text Analysis | Tsinghua Univ.
- Design the work flow for electronic health records analysis:  Word segmentation, key word extraction, dictionary building, vector representation, metric learning.
- Generate medical records dataset via deep generative models. (In progress)
- Undergraduate thesis working on the _Statistical and machine learning methods to recognize terms in clinical texts_, propose a semi-supervised learning approach to address sequence labeling problems in Chinese texts. 
  
#### The University Recommendation System | Tsinghua Univ.
- Design a recommendation list for high school students based on their ranks and scores.
