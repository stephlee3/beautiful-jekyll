### Research Projects
  
#### Cross-Platform Prediction of Regulome Activities
- Use gene expression to predict DNase-level based on [BIRD](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01188-x) 
- Propose normalization methods to deal with the platform effect.
- Work on the paper.
- [See the code here!(In progress)](https://github.com/stephlee3/Cross-Platform-Prediction-of-Regulome-Activities)
  
#### Chinese Medical Text Analysis
- Word segmentation, key word extraction, dictionary building, vector representation, metric learning.
- Deep generative model involving LSTM, GAN.
  
#### The University Recommendation System
- Design a recommendation list for high school students based on their ranks and scores.
