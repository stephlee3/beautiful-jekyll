- Proposed normalization methods to integrate gene expression data from multiple
platforms.
- Extended _Big Data Regression Model_ to perform cross-platform prediction.
- Developed a generalized ridge regression model to penalize the potential bias between platforms. <br/>
<br/>


#### Integrative Analysis of Alpha-Diversity in Microbiome Data

- Developed a two-stage mixed-effect model to investigate the association between alpha diversity and phenotype of interests.
- Proposed a joint hypothesis testing framework to incorporate the mean and variance
component score statistics.
- Systematically designed the simulation studies. <br/>
